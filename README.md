# Building A Sign Up Form 
This is a simple sign up form I built. It is a challenge recommended by The Odin Project (see [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)). I did not implement a mobile view because it wasn't required. Using a table here to organize the form proved very helpful.
